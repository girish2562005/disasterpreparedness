    content: `Earthquakes are sudden shaking of the ground caused by the movement of rock beneath the Earth's surface. They occur when stress that has built up along a fault is suddenly released.

Key Points:
• Earthquakes can happen anywhere, but are more common along fault lines
• The magnitude is measured on the Richter scale from 1-10
• Most earthquakes last less than a minute
• Aftershocks can continue for days or weeks after the main event

Understanding the science behind earthquakes helps us prepare better and respond appropriately when they occur.`,

    id: "drop-cover-hold",
    title: "Drop, Cover, and Hold On",
    content: `"Drop, Cover, and Hold On" is the internationally recommended immediate response to earthquake shaking.

DROP: Immediately drop to your hands and knees
• This prevents you from being knocked over
• Gets you low to the ground quickly
• Protects you from falling objects

COVER: Take cover under a desk, table, or against an interior wall
• Protect your head and neck with your arms if no shelter available
• Stay away from windows, mirrors, and heavy objects that could fall
• Don't run outside during shaking - most injuries occur from falling debris

HOLD ON: Hold onto your shelter and be prepared to move with it
• If under a desk, hold the legs and be ready to move
• If against a wall, protect your head and neck
• Stay in position until shaking completely stops

This technique has saved countless lives and is your best protection during earthquake shaking.`,

Water:
• 1 gallon per person per day for at least 3 days
• Additional water for pets
• Water purification tablets as backup

Food:
• Non-perishable food for at least 3 days
• Can opener and eating utensils
• Special dietary needs (baby formula, medications)

First Aid & Safety:
• Comprehensive first aid kit
• Prescription medications (7-day supply)
• Flashlights and extra batteries
• Battery-powered or hand-crank radio
• Whistle for signaling help

Important Documents:
• Copies of important family documents in waterproof container
• Cash in small bills
• Emergency contact information

Tools & Supplies:
• Multi-purpose tool or Swiss Army knife
• Plastic sheeting and duct tape
• Matches in waterproof container
• Fire extinguisher
• Local maps

Store your kit in an easily accessible location and check expiration dates regularly.`,
